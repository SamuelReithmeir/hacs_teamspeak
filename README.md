2. Extract the `custom_components/samuelre_teamspeak` folder
3. Copy it to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
4. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Via Home Assistant UI (Recommended)

2. Click **+ Add Integration**
3. Search for **TeamSpeak Server Info**
4. Enter your configuration:
   - **Host**: IP address or hostname of your TeamSpeak server

   - **Virtual Server ID**: The ID of your virtual server (usually 1)
   - **API Key**: Your WebQuery API key
   - **Scan Interval**: How often to update (in seconds, default: 60)

## Usage Examples

### Automation: Notify When Server is Full

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "TeamSpeak Server Full Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: template
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.teamspeak_server_clients_online') | int >= states('sensor.teamspeak_server_max_clients') | int }}"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "TeamSpeak server is full!"
```

### Template: Display Active Clients

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      ts_active_users:
        friendly_name: "Active TeamSpeak Users"
        value_template: >
          {% set clients = state_attr('sensor.teamspeak_server_clients_online', 'client_list') %}
          {{ clients | map(attribute='client_nickname') | join(', ') if clients else 'None' }}
```


## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors

1. **Verify WebQuery is enabled**: Check your TeamSpeak server configuration
2. **Test API access**: Use curl to test the API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:10080/1/serverinfo \
     -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```
3. **Check firewall**: Ensure port 10080 (or your custom port) is accessible
4. **Verify credentials**: Make sure the API key is correct and has proper permissions

### Integration Not Showing Up

1. Clear browser cache
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Check `home-assistant.log` for errors related to `samuelre_teamspeak`
